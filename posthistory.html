				<h3>I Thought I’d Write a Poem Today</h3>
					<p>I thought I’d write a poem today,<br>
					But found myself with naught to say.<br>
					I’ve loved, I’ve laughed, I’ve lived some life.<br>
					But nothing comes, no light nor strife.<br>
					No raging fire of passion burns.<br>
					Nor pain or want, nor lover’s yearns.<br>
					I find myself with poet’s block,<br>
					Resorting back to my old stock.</p>
					<p>I think on back to roses red,<br>
					Of violets blue, poetic dread.<br>
					While nothing comes, I dig down deep.<br>
					I want to write to make them weep.<br>
					I want my pen to dance and stroll;<br>
					Creating works that move the soul<br>
					I want my words to stir, evoke<br>
					A jaw to drop as they are spoke</p>
					<p>I thought I’d write a poem today<br>
					But found myself with naught to say.</p>

				<h3>Journey through Meter</h3>

					Counting<br>
					Cursing<br>
					Trying<br>
					Twisting<br>
					Starting<br>
					Stopping<br>
					Fretting<br>
					Fixing<br>

				<h3>Savage Beauty</h3>
				<p>
					There is something to be said for the harsh.<br>
					For the desolate, and the bleak.<br>
					To stand amidst the power of the storm.<br>
					With the wind blowing, the waves crashing<br>
					Threatening your very position<br>
					The sky is dark, the sea is loud<br>
					snow and hail fly all about<br>
					There is a power in the wind,<br>
					A beauty in the sea.<br>
					The storm stirs up the life within<br>
					Brazenly holding against the tempest<br>
					amidst the tumult of the day.<br>
					A beauty exists in all of this<br>
					The feeling and power<br>
					The earth moving and flowing about you<br>
					There is no safety here<br>
					No pleasantness to be found<br>
					The day is rough<br>
					And the sky doesn’t care<br>
					But that is why we expose ourselves<br>
					To feel apart.......<br>
